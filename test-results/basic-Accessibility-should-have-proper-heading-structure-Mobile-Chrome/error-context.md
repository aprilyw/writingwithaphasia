          - paragraph [ref=e69]: I was alone because my husband was out of town. He was on a motorcycle coming back from Dunedin, Florida. I was in bed, and then suddenly, I couldn’t talk. I couldn't say help. I went to the next-door neighbors to get help, but they thought I was drunk because I wasn’t speaking and I was walking funny.
          - paragraph [ref=e70]: They called my husband and said that they thought I was drunk. My husband said that wasn’t possible because I don’t drink. So, the neighbors realized that they should call for an ambulance to Kennestone Hospital. At Kennestone, they realized how severe my condition was and flew me via helicopter to Emory Hospital, the best hospital in the world.

            - text: At Kennestone Hospital, I was a part of the Kennestone Neuro Outpatient Rehabilitation Aphasia Support Group. We’ve met once a month, and I’ve gone all the time for 15 years now. The group was run by speech language pathologists.
          - paragraph [ref=e85]: From my experiences, I learned that many people do not know what aphasia is. Even doctors and nurses! In Kennestone Hospital, there were still many doctors and nurses that didn’t know about aphasia or understand how to help me.
          - paragraph [ref=e86]:
            - text: To help educate doctors and nurses in Kennestone Hospital, our Kennestone Neuro Outpatient Rehabilitation Aphasia Support Group set up a booth in the Kennestone Hospital cafeteria in order to spread education and awareness about aphasia.

          - paragraph [ref=e90]: When my husband and son went home at night, I would hit the Nurse button when I needed help. They would ask, “how can I help you?” over the intercom. However, because of my aphasia, it was hard to tell them what I needed. I needed them to come to my bedside. But, because I had no way of communicating with them, they didn’t know.
