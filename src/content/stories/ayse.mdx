This MDX version of Ayse's story is a work in progress. We'll progressively replace legacy table-based image layouts with semantic components like `ImageGrid` and `Figure`.

## Early Life

Ayse was born in Ankara, Turkey and later moved to Heidelberg, Germany, where she met Don.

## Stroke and Recovery

In November 2009, Ayse experienced an AVM stroke and spent weeks in recoveryâ€”eventually rebuilding her communication abilities through therapy, advocacy, and persistent practice.

## Advocacy

She now speaks (and presents) extensively to raise awareness about aphasia across hospitals, universities, and virtual communities.

> Full content migration pending. (Will replace this note once the remaining narrative and images are structured.)
