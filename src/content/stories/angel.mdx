The morning of February 4, 2023, I woke ready to shine and had a packed day ahead of me. I stood in front of my closet, “What should I wear?” I decided on one of my favorite black dresses and multicolored cardigan, complete with my Air Force One sneakers then headed to Mt. Olivet for a video shoot.  

My producer organized the day for the choir.  I was ready to sing in the choir.  I met singers from various age ranges and backgrounds and knew the connections would lead to more music-making and performing. Our combined voices offered levity.  I left feeling on-top-of-the-world!  I stopped at my friend KaSandra‘s house for conversation and laughter on the way home.  I pumped the music on my ten minute drive.  By the time I returned home to my husband, son, daughter, and granddaughter, I was still beaming!  It was a GREAT day.

That evening at dinner as I chewed my salad roll everything felt like it was in slow motion.    I was looking around but everything was blurry. I kept looking at different spots in the room.

“Are you ok?” asked my granddaughter, noticing my salad roll spilling out of my mouth.

She asked me a second time, “Are you alright, Grandma?” 

I said, “Go get your Papa and PJ.” I was so scared. I didn’t know what was happening to me.  I had food in my mouth, but it was hard to swallow.  Everything was in slow motion!  I tried to go to the bathroom to get the food out of my mouth. Still, slow motion.

PJ arrived and asked, “What’s wrong with you?  Are you OK?”

“I’m OK.  I’m OK.  I’m OK.”

I was NOT OK.   I was scared.  “What is wrong with me?”   Everybody was trying to help me, but nobody knew what to do.  They tried the heimlich maneuver, thinking I was choking.  We didn’t know what was happening.  They decided to call 911.

When the paramedics arrived, they asked a number of questions.  When they asked if I was on drugs or alcohol, I thought it was funny because I rarely drink and don’t smoke.  My brave granddaughter was crying.  She’s my hero because she did what was necessary in that moment. 

In order to prove I was ok, I walked to the ambulance on my own repeating, “I’m OK.  I’m OK.  I’m OK.”  When I got there, I said, “Wait for a minute.”  Then…I passed out.  

***

Two days later, I woke up in the ICU.  My eyes were closed but I heard my friend Crystal praying.  My husband was there too.  I felt his hands on my face and heard his whisper, “I love you.”  My left hand reached for his beard to let him know I loved him too.  I fell back asleep.  

Four days later, I woke up again.  I heard more voices. And again, this time my pastor and other friends.  I was in and out.  Sometimes I heard my daughter, other times my auntie Milly or my cousin from Baltimore.  People were always in the room with me.  Thank God.  I tried to ask, “What are you doing here?”

Nothing came out.  What’s wrong?  What’s happening?

My husband said, “Don’t talk too much.”  He also said, “I know that when people surround you, it will make a difference in your healing.  We are all here for you.”  I was surrounded by friends and family.  They took shifts sitting with me - 24 hours a day.

  <Figure src="/stories/angel/Friends.jpg" caption="Me with friends." />

They were there for me, but they were there for my husband too.  People stopped by offering words of support.  Three of his co-workers had suffered strokes, so they knew a bit about what we were going through.  My husband was ready to do anything for me.  

The day they transferred me to rehab, the hospital staff rolled my bed outside and loaded me into the ambulance.  The sun was shining so bright!  It was the first time I was outdoors in two weeks!  I remember trying to soak up the fresh air and peering out the ambulance windows.  It was a beautiful day.  

While riding on the freeway, I thought to myself,  “What am I doing here?  This is so surreal!  When am I going to wake up from this nightmare?   I can’t move my right side or talk.  What’s my life going to be now?”  At that point, I was convinced I’d be in a wheelchair forever.

 <Figure src="/stories/angel/Rehab.jpg" caption="Chris at rehab with me." />

When I arrived at Good Samaritan Hospital’s Rehabilitation Center, they rolled me inside and settled me in a room.  I was back to the fake lighting and a sterile environment.  It felt like purgatory.  Thankfully my roommate was a bright light!

She welcomed me right away.  “Come on in!” she said, and then asked my name.  I couldn’t say it yet.  So my husband introduced me.  They made small talk.  I sat there and listened.  At one point, she looked at me and said, “You look familiar.  What's your pastor’s name?”  

My husband responded, “Pastor Grace Osborn.”

“I knew I knew you!”  She exclaimed.  “I know your Pastor!”  My husband explained to her that I use to render a song before Pastor Grace would preach or direct the church choir.  I was grateful to be recognized and for my bright spirit.

 <Figure src="/stories/angel/Pastor.jpg" caption="My pastor for 35 years...she's one of my heroes!" />

When she left, she gave me pencils, crossword puzzles, and coloring books and told me they would help me find my words again.  I still have them.  We were only together for four days but that time with her made a lot of difference. She had also lost her ability to talk but was doing much better and used every word to connect or lift others.  I wanted to be like her in many ways.  

Her bed was placed next to the window.  “It’s the best spot in the house!”  She said.  It was.  She made sure to let everyone know it was to be my spot when she left.  When I moved to her bed, I was thankful she shared the window and used her words to comfort, challenge, and lift me.  That gave me hope. 

One night after she left, I was sitting in the room all alone.  It was so quiet and my mind and emotions started spinning.  “What now?  Am I gonna have another stroke? Can I learn to walk again? Will my face ever be symmetrical again?  Will I ever find words to talk and sing again?  What does my future hold?”  The reigning voice was internal and uncertain.

That night, I cried for such a long time.  Nobody was around to hear me.  I felt like I cried for an hour, the tears flowed and my body constricted.  I had so many questions and no answers.  I urged myself and God, “Somehow, I have to get better.”  I felt like the tears were evidence that I was broken.

Song lyrics came to mind, “God make me over again…” I repeated in my mind, then added, “I don’t care what it looks like…”  “Make me over again.  Renew my mind and renew my spirit because I’m so broken.”  By voicing my concerns and pain to God and my family, I gain strength.  I knew God could make me over again.  He had done it before in me and in others.

A couple days later, while laying in bed I signaled my son to unlock my phone.  My brain confused numbers at that point.  While scrolling through Facebook, I saw that a few years ago my pastor's great great grandson was in a motorcycle accident and was in a coma for almost a year.  In his case, when he woke up, everybody was so happy.  He relearned to walk and talk with the spellboard!   I looked at the picture and thought, “If he can do it, so can I!”  I didn’t have words to say that, but I thought it in my mind.  And I continue to tell myself every day, “If he can do it, so can I.”  He let his light shine through recovery.  He used a spellboard but still got his message across and offered me hope.

I had been in the hospital for two and a half weeks and wanted to take a shower but couldn’t get my point across.  It was an endless game of charades.  Throughout that time, I would gesture to the shower and they would say, “Oh! You wanna shower?!”

Winners!  I vigorously shook my head “Yes!”  It seemed like they would always respond, “Yes!  Tomorrow.”

Tomorrow finally came.  A nurse I had never met, wheeled my naked self into the shower.  

“Do you want some music?’ She asked.

I shook my hand vigorously “Yes!”  Little did she know that music had been my life.

I reached out my left hand and looked her in the eyes.  I hope she knew how big that “thank you” was.  She turned on the speaker and it was Kiera Sheard singing Indescribable. 

“You place the stars in the sky and you know them by name, You are amazing, God.” 

I broke down, crying right then. Niagara Falls.  I was grieving.  There was so much loss.  And, I was lost.  In the same breath, I was crying, thankful to be alive.  I was crying, grateful for my relationship with God.  I was crying knowing I had the power to get better. Though I was deeply grieving, there was something at my core that was giving thanks to the nurse and to God.  Naked in the shower, God was making me over again.

The nurse so gently washed my body clean.  She asked me “yes” and “no” questions so we could engage in conversation.  She told me it was ok to cry.  

Worship music reverberated across the shower walls and into my heart.   Lyrics lingered in my mind.  It was so wonderful.  That shower meant so much to me.  It was a baptism of sorts, maybe even a rebirth.

After about a month at Good Samaritan Hospital Rehab Center, I practiced wheeling to the car, maneuvering my 298 pound body in the chair, and shifting my weight into the car.  I was so ready for that day.  I finally rang the discharge bell and returned home.

When we pulled up to our house, my neighbor from across the street waved and said, “We have been praying for you!”  My cat Lola greeted me.  I carefully stepped down two steps into our sunken living room I love so much.  I had practiced that too.  I sat on our big, red, fancy couch, looked around and was mesmerized. “I made it home.  I’m still here.  I’m alive!  I’m here, in my place of peace with my family!”

My youngest was eighteen.  She cooked my favorite meal from scratch: chicken and shrimp fettuccine with broccoli.  I felt so blessed and surrounded by love.  I realize my friends, neighbors, family, church were all telling me how much they loved me through their actions, prayers, and support.  In unison, they spoke through word and deed.

In a way, my home was foreign to me.  My life had totally changed.  

The second day home, my husband and I sat on the couch and cried for so long.  He said,  “In the 20 years I’ve known you, I’ve never seen you cry like this, Angel.”  I was grieving the old Angel.  I used to have fun and sing and talk a lot.  I used to be in charge of the house and now I needed help with everything.  It was scary not to know what the future looked like.

  <Figure src="/stories/angel/Memories.jpg" caption="Another photo of us!" />

That evening, I tried to get up to go to the bathroom. I tripped and fell on the floor.  “Are you ok?”  My husband asked.

“I’m ok.” I responded.  I laid there.  

I was not ok.  I hit another emotional low.  Then I remembered my therapist.  “If you fall, you have to get back up.”  

We had practiced what to do next.  So, I rolled over and placed my left hand on the ground, then my right leg, and my left leg.  I used the strength of my left leg to get up.  I got back up.  I needed to prove to myself I could do it on my own.  But I’ve learned, to stay up, I need community.

My cousin Lynetta from Baltimore moved in with us to help out.  She knew how important community is to me but also knew that my loved ones couldn’t possibly know what it was like to be in my situation.  

  <Figure src="/stories/angel/Cousins.jpeg" caption="Me and my cousins." />

She searched for support groups and found one based in Idaho, led by Kevin Reinhard.  I didn’t want to go.  Lynetta gave me no choice.  She set up the computer and logged me in.  I went to the first meeting and just listened.  I had no words to share.  Kevin Reinhard had his stroke twelve years ago and lives with Aphasia.  He lives with Aphasia AND leads our group!  Like my roommate in rehab, he doesn’t let Aphasia stop him from using his voice for good.  He told me I’d be ok.  

In meetings the first few months, I could only say “yes” or “no.”   But I went every week and listened.  People were patient with each other.  I gradually gained confidence to try to share more than “yes” and “no.”  They patiently waited.  They understood.  We all patiently wait for each other as we regain our voice and share. As I started to talk, they started encouraging me, saying “you are getting better!”  They believed in me when I had very few words. They were patient, understanding, and encouraging.  I was starting to find my community of survivors.

One day my former coworker Stephanie visited me and revealed that she had suffered a stroke five years prior.  I never knew!  I couldn’t even tell!  Her recovery gave me hope.  

When I had my stroke I was 317lbs.  By the time I returned home, I had already lost 20lbs but knew I needed to lose more.  Stephanie brought me fitness magazines with photos that gave me motivation to lose weight.

At that point, I was walking with a cane and also used the wheelchair a bit.  My goal was to walk a whole block.  I knew I could do it.  She upped the ante.

Stephanie announced, in complete certainty, “We are going to climb Mt. Tabor together one day soon.”  

Mt. Taber is a volcano and neighborhood park.  People use trails or stairs to climb it.  I had only driven to the top.  She added,

“We’ll use the stairs our first time.”

“Our first time?!”  I shouted in my mind, not fully convinced there would be a first time or any there after.  “You and I are going to walk to the top?” I questioned aloud.

She nodded.

 “Yeah, right.”  I looked at her in shock, but my head nodded, “yes” with hers.

“This girl is crazy!”  I thought.

But in case Stephanie was serious, I made sure that I was ready.    I didn’t want to let her down.   She was a stroke survivor.  I trusted her and took up the challenge.  I exercised every day; riding the stationary bike and lifting weights.   The pounds dropped but I still struggled with my words.  After six months of that regimen, I called Stephanie and announced, “She ready” in my Tiffany Haddish voice.  Stephanie picked me up the next day and we drove to Mt. Tabor.  

When we arrived at the bottom of the stairway, I asked Stephanie, “You want me to climb the stairs?!  These stairs?!?!”

She pushed out a “YESSS” through her laughter.  

I said “Oh my God….”  So I leaned on the handrail and it guided me the whole way up.  There were three or four flights of stairs.  I climbed slowly, focusing on each knee lift, foot placement, and swing up.

The lyrics to “All I do is Win” repeated in my mind.  “All I do is win, win, win, no matter what (What)...up, down, up, down, up, down….All I do is win, win, win, no matter what (What)”

I stopped to catch my breath for every flight!  People stopped to root for me, “Go! Go! Go!”…lol… So I kept going until I reached the top.  When I reached the top,  I gasped for breath and I did the Rocky dance in my head, complete with the shadowboxing he did at the top of the stairs at the Philadelphia Museum of Art!  

I was so proud of myself and still am!  That was a key point in my physical recovery.  I worked hard for that.  Stephanie voiced her belief in me before I believed in myself but when I started to believe in myself and work at it every day, it became more real. 

We took the long way down, through the trails.  It was so pleasant and we could see the whole city of Portland.  It’s amazing to me.  When I tell you this story, it’s a bit like looking out at the city that day.  There was so much work, frustration, discipline, time, and emotion that went into being able to climb Mt. Tabor but now, as I’m telling you the story, I look back and see the beautiful view.  I see that the struggle was worth it.  I did it.  I have many more mountains to climb but that gave me confidence that I can.

When we reached the bottom, back to where I took the first step, Stephanie asked, “You wanna go again?”  

“Heck no!”  I blurted.  But, I’m competitive, so I DID do it again!  I’m grateful Stephanie knew what I needed at that moment.  She set a challenge, gave me inspiration, believed in me, and accompanied me on the journey.   She used her experience and words to lift me up.

In recovery, there are many challenges, mountains.  The one I’m working on right now is my speech.  Every day I work on recalling words and making conversations flow.

Now, I've been in stroke support groups for a longer time and I can share my voice with others.  I’m patient with them, I understand, I believe, and I encourage.  We are in this together.  We are part of each other’s healing process.  Our facilitator Kevin, says the stroke gave him purpose.  I wanted that too, so I kept going.  The more I go to the meetings, the more I challenge myself, the more my spark turns to fire.  I want to get better.  I want purpose.  I am getting better.  I am finding purpose.


  <Figure src="/stories/angel/NYE.jpeg" caption="The first New Year's Eve after my stroke." />

Now I’m distinctly aware of the way people use their voice.  I’m grateful for my friends and family who were by my side in the hospital whispering faith-filled words into my ears.  I’m grateful for my neighbors, nurses, therapists, church community who offer me hope in word and deed.  


  <Figure src="/stories/angel/Grandson.jpg" caption="Chris with our grandson." />

I’m inspired by my first roommate, my coworker Stephanie, my group facilitator Kevin, and all the survivors I’ve met along the way.  They showed me the importance of reclaiming my voice and using it for good.

“God make me over again.  Renew my mind.  Renew my spirit.”

I use my voice.  I have been called to say it loud and say it often.  I want to be a beacon of light to everybody.  I am a beacon of light to everybody.  I am who I am.  I’m all heart.  I tell it like it is and now that I’ve had this experience, I’m more equipped to offer patience, belief, encouragement, and support.

I used to feel small but now I have confidence.  People have been rooting me on.  I still struggle to find words, but when I talk, people listen.  My voice matters.  I matter.  My experience matters.  My thoughts and feelings matter.  And so does yours.  If you don’t believe it yet.  We are here, patiently waiting for YOU to join our choir of purpose, connection, and hope.
