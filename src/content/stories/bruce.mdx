I grew up in the suburbs of Detroit in Hazel Park. I grew up doing very well. We didn't have much money, but I had two incredible parents. They coached my baseball team and attended my football and hockey games. It was really great–until they got divorced. And then it was kind of different. But I still did everything. I still did baseball and football and hockey, and I acted in plays. I started music, too, when I was in choir in junior high. I was in chorale, which is kind of like Glee without the trauma. And I was really good there. That's what I did when I was younger. 

And then I went to college. I went to Central Michigan with, as it turns out, my wife who lived next door to me. At Central Michigan, I was a residential assistant for three years. After this, I got to be a hall director in Wisconsin while I was pursuing my master's degree in higher education. Finally, I went to the University of Michigan where I started my doctorate. While I was there, I realized it was different from what I wanted. 

Eventually, my work turned into proposals. I was the proposal director at Plante Moran. At that time, I still played hockey, baseball–all that. I also played the guitar, keyboards, bass, harmonica–anything that you can do with a piece of equipment. At one point, I actually had 16 guitars (which I still have). Everything I did during that phase of life was all centered around music.

I joined my first band when I was in 12th grade as a senior. I had guitars before then, but I didn’t play them that much. I played with the Shaughnessies, who lived in the house behind mine. We got together, we started playing, and that was Brothers Inc, which is still one of my bands today. Once I started working at Plante Moran, I started to play in many more bands. I joined the Robin Moore Band, Spitted Nickles, Six and the Sevens, <a href="https://www.madigansattic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 underline decoration-1 underline-offset-2 hover:text-blue-700">Madigan’s Attic</a>, Chrissy Morgan, and McSpillin. It was really good. My favorite back in the day was Brothers Inc. That really hits me in my heart. I just played with them  two days ago.

On July 11, 2020, I went out for a bike ride (which I normally did about two to four times a week). I’d go about 10 miles right around the neighborhood. I told my wife, “I'm going to go out for a bike ride.” 

I really remember her saying this next part: “You know, you really got to think about a helmet.” I thought, “I don't like them. They're kind of, they're not cool, you know? But I'll think about it.”

I thought about it. And then I went out the doors. 

I got a block away and then I flipped over my handlebars into the curb with my head. 

And that's not a good thing. I don't remember any of this. But my wife says she heard the sirens and she thought, “You know, maybe there's somebody over there, but I'm not doing anything. I'll just continue washing the dishes.” 

After a while, she thought, “I'll call him, tell him to take a different way.”

I wasn't answering. 

She went on Google and saw that I was right here, so she thought that maybe I was helping. She went outside and saw people all around and an ambulance. She saw everybody except for me. I wasn't there. 

She asked the policeman, “Who's that you're working on there?” And he said, “It's nothing, nothing to see here. It's just a medical event.”

My wife asked, “Did it involve a bicycle?”

“Oh...Where do you live?” 

“Right here?” 

“Oh…,” they told her, “Well, we’re getting in the ambulance right now. You better get to the hospital because it's really, really grim.”

I went to the hospital, which was less than a mile away. I was in a coma for over a month. 

<Figure src="/stories/bruce/Bruce coma.jpg" caption="Me during my coma." />
It's funny. I'd never been to a hospital in my life before this. Never. When I woke up, everybody was masked up because this was COVID time. I didn't know why I was there. When I got to my head, I realized, ”Oh my God, I hit my head.” That's as much as I knew. About then, my wife came up and she said that the doctors gave me a 15% chance of surviving. Wow. Then, my injury became infected while I was at the hospital, so they had to treat the infection with surgery. Again, another 15% chance. 

But I got through. And I got home. 

That's how it all happened. I don't really know these events besides what the witnesses told me. I can remember everything before. I can tell you my childhood dreams, all those things. I can tell you everything after. This, I have no idea.

At first, I couldn't move my right arm. I thought I’d had a stroke because that's one of the symptoms. But after I got my arm to move, I realized it wasn’t that. 

I couldn't talk at all. I thought I was, but I wasn’t. It was really frustrating. My wife's name, Jeanne, was one of the first words I had. After, I got to “yes” and “no.” Word by word, I got a little bit more, but it was really frustrating to not be talking at all for about three or four months. 

Slowly, I started to get to where I am now. My speech is still not as good as it used to be, but so it goes. My wife is a nurse, and she really helped me. 

<Figure src="/stories/bruce/Bruce and Jeanne.jpg" caption="Me and my wife, Jeanne." />

When I was in the hospital, my wife brought one of my guitars up to see if I could play. I could thread the strings, but I couldn't strum at all. For about a year, I couldn’t play it. I tried to play once a week. I’d pick it up and I wouldn't be able to do it. About a year later, before I had my surgery, I thought, “Maybe I'm just not a guitar player anymore. Wow.” 

I had surgery about 13 months after my accident. After my surgery, I got my guitar and I picked it up. It was like magic. Everything had come back to me. At first, I’d drop the pick once in a while. But now I don't do it at all anymore. 

It was similar with singing. I used to be a really good singer. My bands have recorded 8 albums. I was with a band called Twelve Bridges, and we were about halfway done with recording our album when I hit my head.

When I was in my coma, they put a lot of tubes down my throat. They don't ever think about what that means when they pull them out. For me, it meant scar tissue, and that meant my voice was not as pleasant anymore. After I left the hospital, I didn’t really think about music as a singer because I didn’t sing much anymore. 

But now I do. It's kind of funny. I had another surgery after five years (that’s another story). I started looking at some of my music and I could sing again.

Not being able to talk continues to be a struggle for me because I used to be a presenter. 

The year before I had my accident, I was the number one speaker in APMP for three years in a row. I was really good up there speaking on the stage and getting people into it. After the accident, I’ve returned to the stage but with a different story. I’ve presented my own story and shared who I was before the accident, what happened during the accident and my rehab, and who I am now after. But when I present now, I have to stay on point with everything, because if I'm not, everything's whack.

Things like getting people's names right and where they live is really frustrating, even currently. For instance, my son lives in Marquette, which is in the Upper Peninsula. I knew him, but I couldn't remember his name for about nine months. I knew where he lived. I knew what his house looked like. It took a year for me to remember he lives in Marquette. It was the same thing with my mother-in-law. I knew who she was, but I only remembered her name about nine months later. Now I know that she lives in Oxford. 

But everybody with aphasia has different symptoms. That's the way it is.

I’ve met a lot of people with aphasia through Lingraphica. I also have a few group therapies with the University of Michigan and Corewell Health.

<Video src="https://vimeo.com/712152943" title="Their Words: An Aphasia Documentary Series — Episode 3: Bruce" caption="A documentary I made with Lingraphica." />

I think for most people, when they have an accident, they don’t talk to anybody. They decide they’re only going to have a few close friends who support them, and that's about it. Whereas for me, even after my TBI, I was like, “Hey, what's everybody going to do this week? Because I want to do something.” For instance, I sometimes go out to the Gaelic League, where I perform once a month.

<Figure src="/stories/bruce/Gaelic.jpg" caption="Me performing at the Gaelic League." />

When I went down and I was in a coma, everybody who remembered me before also remembered me afterwards, and they were always rooting for me. They were always calling me up. I would call them too because keeping all your friends is really important. Some of the best friends I had, I still have. 

You just keep growing. Right now, I still don’t speak as well as I used to, but I'm getting better, I think. Every day is a new day. 

And if I can do one thing better, good. Then, I'll be better the next time.
