---


My whole life, I have lived in Lynn, Massachusetts. I lived with my mother, my father and my younger brother. We were just a five minute walk away from the rest of my family: Auntie Anna, Auntie Jo, Uncle John, Auntie Ellen.

My grandfather and grandmother, the Chiaradonna’s, lived right up the hill. They had come to America from Italy by boat. They were stopped at Ellis Island and ended up in Lynn because there were a lot of Italian immigrants who lived there. In Lynn, they bought land, built their house, and all nine of their children lived there with them. They ran a farm and had lambs, cows, and all sorts of fruits like pear trees, apple trees – everything. 

Because my older cousins and my aunts and uncles wanted to talk, I would play with the kids. I would always play school and it was so fun. In the summer, we would use sidewalk chalk and make hopscotches and stuff like that. I would always say, “Keep it in line. You will be first, you will be second.” That’s when I started to think that I could really be a teacher.

When I was in high school, we had a career day. We had to sign up for two career sessions that we wanted to attend and then go to that room, sit at a desk, and listen to professionals from that career. At the time, I really wanted to be a photographer. I had tons of pictures. I was still interested in teaching, but in high school, I was more interested in photography.

So, the first career talk I went to was about photography. I thought it was so exciting… until the photographer said, “news doesn’t wait if you’re in bed and you’re sleeping. A story could happen at 2, 2:30 in the morning. Even if you are sleeping, you still have to wake up and go.”

When I heard we were on call twenty-four hours a day, I thought, that’s really not for me. So, I went to the session about teaching. After the teaching session, I decided that teaching was a better path for me.

I got into Boston College as an education major and decided to go there. My grandfather Borrelli wanted me to have a more stable career, so he was always telling me, “You know, if teaching doesn’t work out, I have a friend at the bank who would hire you as a teller. You tell me, and it’s done.”

<Figure src="/stories/mary/Roommates.jpg" caption="My roommates from Boston College." />

“But, grandpa,” I would say, “I don’t want to do banking. I want to teach.” So I went to Boston College to study education. 

When I was at Boston College, we had a consortium at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston. At this consortium, you could interview right on the spot for a teaching job. I said, “Oh, I’m going to put my name down as an elementary school teacher for Long Beach, California, Elmira, New York, and Ridgewood, New Jersey.” I thought to myself that I probably wouldn’t be called for all these places. 

The Elmira school district gave me a job offer and four months to decide if I wanted the position. Ridgewood also gave me an offer. At the time, I decided I wanted to work in Ridgewood.

But then it was senior week, and we had to clean out our dorms. When I got home, my mother told me to look at this little red circle on her body. I said, “Mom, I don't know what it is, but you have to go to the doctors.” 

After April, May, June, July, August, September, October, she finally said, “Can you come with me?” 

The new doctor in Swampscott, the town over from us, said, “I think that it’s cancer, but we have to do more testing.” 

<Figure src="/stories/mary/IMG_0101.jpg" caption="The last photo my mother and I took together." />

I canceled my teaching plans and stayed at home with my mother. I still wanted to stay in teaching somehow though. That year, they had a position for a nursery school teacher at the YMCA. It was morning and afternoon classes, and then I could go home. That was good, because I could take my mother to all of her appointments. 

Working at the YMCA helped because it served as a respite when I wasn’t going with my mother to appointments. After a year, I got promoted to the Director of Youth Services because the former director was leaving the position. However, a year and a half after my promotion, my mother passed away after two years of chemotherapy and radiation. It was really hard.

All of the children at the YMCA helped me to get through my mother’s passing. But I thought, now it’s really the time to see if I’m cut out for teaching. So I put my name out as a substitute for the Lynn public school system. After three months, I started getting calls for openings, so I resigned my position as Director of Youth Services. 

I worked as a substitute teacher in all 17 schools in the Lynn district, but I most often got called to substitute for Washington Community School in downtown Lynn. It was actually right across from the YMCA! A lot of the teachers would request me because I ruled with an iron fist. 

After two years of subbing, the lady in charge of personnel called me down and said they had a job for me. It was teaching second grade at Washington. I said, “Oh yeah, I’ll take that.”

<Figure src="/stories/mary/Teachers.jpg" caption="Me and my teacher friends from Washington Community School." />
I loved it there and stayed for 22 years. I got to do a lot of different things like be a first grade teacher, a second grade teacher, and a third grade teacher. When I was at Washington, I took classes to be certified as an English Language Learning (ELL) teacher because there were so many kids at Washington from all over the world. For instance, we had many Portuguese, Dominican, Guatemalan and Greek kids where English was not their first language.

After teaching third grade for 6 years, Jeff, the principal, told me that we needed someone to cover ELL for a year. So I took over.

<Figure src="/stories/mary/ELLFirstGradeClassroom.jpg" caption="My first grade ELL classroom." />

I liked it. But the next year they cut the ELL teaching position. I was going to go back to my third grade classroom. But my principal said, “Mary, come here in the office. Would you like to teach fifth grade?” So instead of teaching third grade, I taught fifth grade.

During one of my summers teaching, I ran a summer school program with another teacher Deborah. One year, we taught a drama class called “So You Want to Be a Star.” This class had kids from second to fifth grade and who spoke many different languages, including Greek, Spanish, and Cambodian. At the end of the summer, we created a play based off of the book, The Great Kapok Tree.

Every student did something different. Some painted scenery, some created the set. Some wanted to do the makeup. One girl wanted to get us a limousine for the day we performed our play! I said, “Okay, but we have to think about all of the things this involves.”

She made a list of every step we needed to take despite only being a rising fourth grader. I was with her when she called the limousine companies, trying to get a good deal from them. In the end, we actually got a deal we could afford.

On the day of the play, Deborah and I went to school together really early. We rolled out a plastic red tablecloth on the school steps. Then, we took the limousine we had rented and picked up each student from their home. As we picked up the students, we gave them a pair of sunglasses. When they got to school, they were ready to take on Hollywood!

Even after the play, these students took their work and repurposed it for the Lynn youth parade in August. They put all of their scenery onto a flat-bed truck they borrowed from a towing company that one of the students’ fathers worked at. All of the students wore their costumes and makeup that day. Then, they used Deborah’s karaoke machine to take turns reading The Great Kapok Tree! 

<Figure src="/stories/mary/Parade.jpg" caption="Everyone at the Lynn youth parade." />

Eventually, after twenty-four years of teaching, I decided to try and go for a principal position. After two years of graduate studies, I sent a bid out in June to become a principal. While I didn’t get principalship the first time, the deputy superintendent emailed me and said, “Mary, you knocked it out of the park. You have to go again. I’m telling you. You are meant to be a principal.”

And a year later in October, there was an opening for the Hood School, which I had attended as a kid. I was the first person they asked to step in as acting principal. For two months, I worked there as the principal. I loved it, getting the promotion and a chance to run my school as I saw fit. I would always be in the lunchroom. There were three lunch periods and I would talk to the kids as they were eating. As I was the principal, the school seemed to calm down a little.

<Separator />
I was working late at school one night as principal. Around 7:30pm, I went home. I had something for dinner, and I went to sleep. And then I woke up on January 28th, 2010. I remember thinking, “Oh, I better jump in the shower and I will get to school before the kids.” I liked to say hello to them in the schoolyard before class and talk about their day. 

I turned on the shower. I felt dizzy, so I decided I should shut the shower off, go to my bedroom, rest for 5 minutes, and then go back to take a shower and start my day. While I was walking towards my bedroom, I fell. I said, “Help!” In this moment, when I thought I was yelling help, what came out was something garbled.

On that day, there was a principal’s meeting. It was the first time I was going to be at a principal’s meeting. When I didn’t show up, my former principal called the school secretary and said, “Hey, Mary isn’t here. I don’t know why. Tell her that she really is a principal and to get down here.”

My friend Deborah, who was also teaching at Hood School while I was there, noticed something was off when she went to the schoolyard and couldn’t find me before school. Deborah went to the office and asked the secretary where I was. This happened right as my former principal was also asking where I was.

Deborah knew where I lived and decided to go check in on me. But, because she walked to school, she had to ask another teacher for a ride. When she got to my house, she knocked on the front door. Nobody responded. Deborah knew that I parked my car in the back, so she checked if my car was there. 

When she saw that my car was there, she immediately called 911. They connected her to the fire department. When they found me, I thought I was talking, but I wasn’t making sense.

The firemen put a blanket around me. I said, “thank you.” That’s the only thing I remembered until three weeks later when I recovered.

I woke up three weeks later in the intensive care unit in Massachusetts General Hospital. Two days later after waking up, I was transferred to Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. The day that I arrived, I started working with my therapy team, which included my speech pathologist, my occupational therapist, and my physical therapist. 

<Video src="/static/videos/mary/IMG_0007.mp4" title="Occupational Therapy session" caption="Occupational Therapy session early in my recovery." maxWidth="620px" />

Four weeks later, my neuropsychologist took me to get a language evaluation. At this moment, I realized for the first time that I would have to learn to read and write again.

I told him, “I want to go back to my room. I want to go back to my room.” He tried to calm me down. I wouldn’t have it. I just wanted to go back to my room. 

I cried and cried. Then I said, I am going to come back from this.

After my stroke, there was a progression. First, I could not speak at all for three months. All I could do was shake my head: yes and no. When I did my first word spontaneously, it was at Spaulding. I said, “Tailgate!” This was because I had gone to Boston College and we were fierce competitors with Boston University. When I was thinking about Boston College, I suddenly remembered all of our tailgates. And then the word came out. 

During my time at Spaulding, I was very anxious. I needed to speak again. I would always ask my speech therapist for extra homework. 

It was also very difficult to walk after my stroke. I spent nine weeks of recovery at Spaulding. Every day, we would work on my exercises. Before my physical therapist brought me to my room, she would call in my physiatrist. My physiatrist and one of their aides would walk with me down the stairs and then back up the stairs. I was so exhausted after that I had to get in my wheelchair to go back to my room.

By the time I left Spaulding for the step-down facility, Sherrill House, in Boston, I was doing three words in a sentence. My brother got Scrabble for me. That’s when I really started to learn the letters and the sounds again. I slowly began speaking more clearly.

  <Figure src="/stories/mary/SherrillTeacher.jpg" caption="Me with my teacher friends from Washington Community School." />
</ImageGrid>

I would always try to formulate a sentence that had the 5 Ws. What? Who? Why? When? Where? 

I finally came home in August 2010. I did my home therapy – speech language and occupational therapy. In October, I was told to look for an outpatient facility to keep on working on my recovery. I wanted to go to Spaulding but they told me it was a six month wait. I couldn’t wait that long. I ended up going to a satellite Spaulding location that was further away.

<Figure src="/stories/mary/Cake.jpg" caption="A cake from the fundraiser party." />

When I was doing my outpatient therapy here, my speech therapist, Jerry, said there was going to be an intensive aphasia program at Boston University for six weeks. He asked me if I wanted to be a part of this. I said yes. 

Two weeks went by and I was working with my occupational therapist when Jerry came in and told me that I was accepted into the Boston University intensive aphasia program. There was going to be a lot of speech therapy as well as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and nutrition classes at lunch. I was so happy to be accepted.

<Figure src="/stories/mary/PTBU.jpg" caption="Physical Therapy at Boston University." />

When I was at the intensive aphasia program, I volunteered to participate in a pilot therapy called Constant Therapy. This entailed speech therapy every day for six months.

<Figure src="/stories/mary/Bean.jpg" caption="Canine Assisted Aphasia Group - Bean, the comfort dog of Boston University." />

I also started to talk with my doctor at the Aphasia Resource Center about going back to teaching, but I didn't know if I could take a full day of school. 

I called a friend and former colleague, Helen, who was the principal at Lincoln Thompson, to ask if I could work with their ELL students. I wanted to see if I was able to teach a full school week without being too fatigued.

Helen said, "Sure, there's a lot of help that we need from you." So I went and taught the first day.

<Figure src="/stories/mary/2ndESL.JPG" caption="Second grade ELL students." />

I incorporated "wait time." I would always say to the students after I spoke, "There is one minute of think time, and then we can go around the room and see what you have to say." While they were thinking, I was also formulating my words so that I could speak afterwards. While wait time is a strategy for ELL students, I could use it for my own thoughts as well.

I ended up working at Lincoln Thompson for the full school year. At the end of the year, I had a meeting with Helen. I said, "So Helen, what do you think of my language skills? Do the kids think that they can understand me? Enough that I can be back in a classroom setting?" And she said, "Of course you can be a teacher again."

The superintendent of Lynn public schools said, "I'm so glad this day has come. You have earned it. I'm going to look at the postings, and I will call you back in an hour." And then she came, she did her magic, and an hour later, she called and said, "Mary, I want to congratulate you on your new position as an ELL teacher at Lincoln Thompson." I said, "What? There isn't a job there."

The superintendent said, "there is now."


As I started my second year at Lincoln Thompson, I was asked by the Constant Therapy team I had worked with if I could speak about Constant Therapy as someone who had gone back to work after my aphasia. I agreed to be interviewed and ended up on Channel 5 News!

I stayed at Lincoln Thompson as the ELL teacher for ten years until I had accrued enough time to retire at 80%.

When I was sad at the very beginning after my stroke, I used to cry all the time when I was at Spaulding and Sherrill House. Even when I was back teaching for two years, I would go to shower and I would cry for five minutes. I would mourn the life that I lost. But then I would say, "It is a new beginning. I have things to offer, and I just have to speak slowly and formulate my thoughts and I will get them out."

</ImageGrid>

I would say to others, "I have aphasia. Do you know what that is?" When they said no, I explained that it was a communication disorder that resulted from my stroke.

The last message I would like to pass is, patience, patience, patience! Because I live with aphasia, you have to be patient with me. 

I might have to take a long time to speak, but I will speak.
