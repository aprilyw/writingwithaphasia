Growing up in Cebu City, the Philippines, my siblings, cousins, and I would memorize pop songs–lots of ABBA.  We’d choreograph dances, gather outfits, and perform on our makeshift stage. We used our creativity, worked together, laughed, and entertained.  We even performed for the nuns at Carmelite Monastery for the New Year’s celebration every January 1st.  That was a highlight of my year.  We spread joy.  Singing and dancing made me feel so alive, happy, and deeply connected.  

At one point, I told my parents that I wanted to be a singer and dancer. However, by the time I was 30, my life had taken me in a very different direction.  I was 210 lbs, 5’1”, and my blood pressure hit 250 mmHg.

I’d inconsistently been taking blood pressure and blood sugar medications.  I would eat anything and everything, especially chips, candies and chocolate. I saw no need for exercise which was odd because by that time, I was a nurse. 

I worked hard to earn the auditor position at a BPO call center for a company in the US.  It was a sought after position and paid well.  I worked nights.  My flexible schedule and extra cash allowed more time to hang out, eat, and smoke, and on the weekends, I’d drink alcohol. I felt I needed to relieve the stress from work. I was very depressed and often upset with others during that time period. I used to pray, **“I want a reset.”**
***
The reset came on November 22, 2016. I was eating breakfast with friends and hanging out after work. Suddenly, my head started throbbing and I felt dizzy. Later that day, I rushed to the bathroom, vomited twice, and was incontinent. All of a sudden, the room felt dark. I looked around then covered one eye and everything was light. I covered the other. Dark.  I couldn’t see out of my right eye!  I knew that was a dangerous symptom. 

I turned to my boss and asked him to call ERUF (Emergency Rescue Unit Foundation) and told him that it was an emergency. That’s the ambulance system in Cebu City in my home country. My dad is a founder of the response system. He’s also a pulmonologist there.

They say that when the emergency rescue arrived, the paramedics realized that I was the daughter of “the pulmonologist.” They contacted my dad immediately.

The doctors found that I had an Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM) and performed a major craniotomy on my brain.  When I finally woke, my sister told me that I didn’t have hair anymore. What a nightmare!  My long hair was my favorite part of my body! I laid there with tears rolling down my cheeks.  I soon found that hair was only part of my loss.

At one point, my sister Kyna put the phone in my right hand. I looked down and asked, “What is this?” poking my right hand with my left. I sounded like a two year old. She responded, “That’s your hand.”

“This is my hand,” I waved my left in the air.  

Kyna smiled and giggled a bit.  “You have two hands.”

I looked down at my right hand and was confused. I simply said, “Oh it’s for my phone!” From my point of view, that hand was a separate object. A necessary object. We all need a phone holder.

I was grateful that many friends and family members visited me in the hospital, but I couldn’t tell them. I knew they were important people in my life, but I could not recall their names, even my best friends, my own sisters, my parents as well. It was frustrating, discouraging, and lonely not being able to get my point across.

On a rainy night while laying in the hospital bed, I prayed to God, asking for guidance and help. I gazed over at my sister Kyna’s sleeping body curled on the thin visitor’s bed next to me. I cried.  I had so much pent up emotion and so much fear. I checked to make sure I wouldn’t upset anyone and once I knew I was alone, I let it all out. The room was eerily dark and silent. Then, I started to cry hard. My sobs echoed from wall to wall in that small hospital room. I tried to hold it in, but I was bursting at the seams. By then, I realized I no longer had a job that I worked hard to earn. I cried because my boyfriend left me. I cried because I almost died. I cried because I couldn’t remember things. And I cried even more because I was scared of my future. Would I ever be the same?

And when I could weep no more, my whole body released as if it surrendered. I was exhausted. I just laid there and looked at the ceiling.  **“One day, I will be ok. Bahala na.”**  That’s the name for God in Filipino. “Bathala”.  The words sounded like a mother’s to a crying baby. I fell asleep. 

When I woke up the next morning, I felt refreshed.  My tears were my own little secret.  So were my words with Bathala.  That morning, my senses must have been heightened.  Everything was so bright, the hospital lights and sun shining through the windows.  It was a stark difference from the dark, rainy night before. Everything felt new and exciting.  I felt so different.  Looking back, maybe I had to fully surrender before accepting the reset offered.

Soon after, my physical therapist entered my room with a joyful smile, 

“Time to go outside?”

He had worked with my right arm and leg, and we had already practiced foot placement leading up to that, but this was a special day.

My excitement boiled over. I sat in bed, reaching out my arm toward him. He helped me stand and supported my side. I wanted to walk so fast. I wanted to show everyone what I had regained.  He stood next to me, reminding me to focus. I needed to focus on each foot placement, maneuver, and weight shift. I needed to be careful. I felt so ready to get up and go, but he was urging me to be methodical and cautious.

The hallway was bright. The blue sky was a reminder of my progress and readiness to move forward. My senses were heightened. The sounds of a busy hospital. The scent of clean sheets. It all made me very happy. I didn’t have words to name any of it, but everything was so new, so bright, so alive!  Moments like these faded in and out during the next couple months.  

When we returned home, my sister and cousins, who are both nurses, took care of me. My mom, who is also a doctor, went to the speech therapy unit in her hospital and found a speech pathologist to visit our house every other day.

I distinctly remember the day the clean-cut speech pathologist and I sat in the living room for an extensive exam. There were cards with numbers and pictures that I needed to identify and sentences I was asked to complete. It was discouraging because I knew the answers; I just couldn’t say them. It was so frustrating for me. But it clearly showed what I was going through in my daily life at the time. I knew everything. It just wasn’t coming out.

He told me I had conduction aphasia. I had difficulty reading, writing and following conversations. I still have difficulty understanding multi-step directions.

When he gave me the diagnosis,I was really sad at first. I was also hopeful that one day I’d be ok and able to speak again. He was hopeful too.

It was hard for me because I had to start from scratch — ABC’s, reading, writing. I needed speech therapy. I couldn’t say my parents’ names or even my own!

I kept offering people food and broken speech. In the Philippines, food and hospitality are very important. I was doing everything I could to stay involved.  But my involvement was like that of a little kid. I needed a lot of help. I was still signaling for things I wanted because I struggled to find the words. I needed help around the house because I was still learning how to move around without vision on my right side. People had to be very patient with me. I have to be patient with myself.

Even though I was surrounded by loved ones, that time was very lonely. I laid in bed with my phone. Technology was my friend.  Together we made our own therapeutic fun. The StoryBots show on YouTube taught me the ABC’s. The app Lumosity helped exercise my brain. Duolingo was helpful for me too. I’ve always loved learning languages. I speak English, Cebuano, Tagalog, a little Spanish, and limited Chinese. I used Duolingo to reconnect those neuropathways.

I had so much time. I laid in bed and tried to keep myself busy.  One day I was listening to Hands Down by Dashboard Confessional and it reminded me of my college years. My best friends and I would spend time at the cafe, listening to music. We would put Hands Down on repeat, scream the lyrics, and laugh together. This song brought me back to that moment that I felt so alive and connected. They were moments of pure joy, but I could no longer retrieve the lyrics to sing joyfully–or so I thought.  

At first, I tried to listen and remember the lyrics. Then, while laying in bed, I started humming and my foot found the beat. Then the chorus came. I sang,

“Hands down, this is the best day I can ever remember…” 

I sang the words, loud and clear! I laughed in astonishment. I remembered the words! AND sang them clearly! I felt so happy! When I finished singing the song, I let my playlist go and sang song after song.  I remembered all the lyrics and they came out on time! I ended up singing three full songs from different bands and I was so grateful, excited, and amazed that the words were on time, loud, and clear! Had I made a miraculous recovery? It was exhilarating!

I soon found that singing was easier than talking. I took it as a mini-win. I love to sing. It feels like joy leaving my body and is so natural for me. It took me back to those moments performing on the makeshift stage as a kid with my cousins.  

Once I realized I could, I regularly sang songs and danced around the house. I felt so free after feeling restricted in so many other ways. I’d belt out my favorite songs. Sometimes, people would sing along. Other times, they’d laugh.  Either way, we were spreading joy and I found a way to express myself and connect.

When the time came to plan for our New Year family performance at the Carmelite in Cebu City, I was ready.  In addition to preparing my part, I took the responsibility of coordinating with the others.  I connected with my nephews, nieces, and cousins about their acts, collected their song choices, and worked to organize everything —from downloading music to setting up microphones, bluetooth speakers, and backups.
That day was incredible.  I was overjoyed to be with my family and give thanks to God. I realized it was the day I prayed for in the hospital, when I sobbed and finally surrendered.  Thank you, Lord! Bahala na.”
The first time I performed on stage after my stroke, I sang One Day by Matisyahu with my cousin Nevin. Since I couldn’t say all the lyrics, I sang the chorus while he carried the rest. It was a deeply joyful and proud moment—performing again.

That ceremony was more than a New Years offering for me. It was a moment when everything came together. At the Mass, I had lots to give thanks for. I offered gratitude for my family, friends, brain, body, voice, and my reset. I was grateful to perform, sing, dance, and spread joy. I had learned to let go and trust. All that matters in life now is faith, hope, and love. Thanks be to God! May I use my gifts and talents to spread joy.
