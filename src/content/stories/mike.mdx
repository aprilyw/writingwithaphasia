On January 16, 2017, I wrapped up my day teaching Special Ed and Life Skills to 18-20-year-olds at the Green Thumb Community Transition Program and headed to Cleveland High to coach wrestling.  I was on top of the world, pouring my heart into my job, my toddler, Leo, and my wife, Amy, who was also a teacher.

That afternoon practice,  I felt off and had a stomach ache. Hoping a milkshake might help, I swung by Burgerville for a hazelnut shake on my way home.  The best.  But it didn’t help.  

By the time I returned home fifteen minutes later, I still wasn’t feeling well.  I felt a fight-or-flight rush.  I knew my 48-year-old body well and knew something was wrong. So I told Amy.  Neither of us likes ERs.  Who does? They’re slow and expensive—but her gut told her we had to go.

The ER doctor noticed I was losing focus and slurring my words—signs of a stroke. They did a CT scan, didn’t find a stroke, and sent me home. Exhausted, I fell asleep and slept a lot.

Two days later, I woke from a nap and tried to get out of bed but collapsed. My whole right side was numb and weak. Struggling to breathe, I shouted, “Amy, call 911.” Panicked, I closed my eyes, gasping for air.  It was so scary!  I couldn’t breathe!

Then a calm feeling washed over me. “Breathe through your nose,” the feeling said.  I’m a mouth breather, so this felt unnatural, but I tried it. My breath steadied, and I felt a deep sense of peace. I trusted that presence and knew I was going to be okay.
The paramedics arrived quickly and started to cut my shirt. 

“Please don’t ruin my new Oregon State Beavers shirt!” I pleaded. Luckily, they were fans too.
“We won’t disrespect Benny the Beaver,” they joked, offering much-needed levity and calming me down.
***
My next memory is of a tube forcing its way through my nose and endless poking as they searched for veins. I remember yanking out the feeding tube, the beeping, and fingers pushing the tube back in. I couldn’t swallow. There was a suction device, like at the dentist, pulling out my saliva. I felt scared, upset, angry and so uncomfortable.  I just wanted to go home. It was all so confusing and overwhelming.

I wanted to see my dogs, be with Leo, and get to a safe place. Amy remained hopeful; she’d read survivor stories and believed my swallowing would return soon.

It was all a blur. The next thing I remember is being in a small, lonely room at the rehab facility. They wouldn’t let Amy stay overnight. But one day, she walked in with a big white envelope full of colorful letters, pictures, and gifts from my students. There was a calendar, a crayon rainbow, collages, and photos of animals, food, anything that made them happy. 

They sent their joy to my dreary room, transforming it into a place of hope. It lifted my spirits, and I couldn’t help but smile and laugh, telling Amy about each student. I knew the effort it took to make those cards, and I could feel their love. My focus shifted from fear to gratitude for each kid. They were teaching me the importance of looking past myself and that there’s always something I can do for others.  

I wasn’t ready to learn that quite yet.
***
When I finally made it home, I felt a sense of relief, but I had no idea what lay ahead—the real battle. A battle I never asked for. 

My entire life had been centered around helping others. I’ve always been the person to step in when someone falls. I was an EMT, and at the time of my stroke, I was working in a special education classroom, teaching life skills to students.

"Now what?" I wondered, consumed by self-pity. "I can’t eat. I can’t swallow." It felt like I was in the third round of a wrestling match, on the verge of being pinned— a position no wrestler ever wants to be in.

Many of my lifelong friends faded away. We’d shared so much—loss, joy, and everything in between. They were my BOYS.  But the stroke was different. Maybe they didn’t know how to act around me. Maybe I didn’t know how to act around me. 

Everything had changed.  It was painful.  As an Astrological Leo, I'm a loyal friend through and through, but I had to begin to let go.  It was a painful process.
My dad always told me, "Treat all things good and everything will be ok."

I felt I had followed his advice to that point, but everything didn’t feel “ok.”

"Why me?" I asked, falling into a dark depression. I felt lost, hurt, mad, afraid, and lonely. I was still using a machine to suck out my saliva and was fed through a G-J tube. It was miserable.
I couldn’t swallow, was constantly hungry, and missed real food. I dealt with hunger pains all day long. The food keeping me alive was terrible—the smell, taste, texture—everything about it made my stomach churn. I fought with my nutritionist to settle on an organic green blend, but feeding myself became an exhausting process. 

Some days, I just couldn’t do it. I still struggle with it, and I’ve come to accept that this is a challenge I’ll always face.

Nurses were constantly in and out of my house, and I made countless trips to the ER because my feeding tube kept coming out. Each time I arrived, they’d say, "Mike’s coming in…" We had our routine down, with a room set up for me, as if it were an emergency every time. Without that tube, I couldn’t eat. The hospital knew me well.
When I slept, the tubes would come out, and food would spill everywhere. 

Over the years, I’ve learned to manage it, but in the beginning, it was messy—physically and emotionally.

Before the stroke, I didn’t drink—beer never sat well in my stomach. But at some point, I hit my low. I popped open a bottle of liquor, poured it into a cup, then into the syringe and shot it into my tube that pumped alcohol straight into my system. I needed relief. I deserved relief. I followed that shot with another, day after day.   It sporadically eased my pain but I would wake up feeling worse. My low just kept getting lower.

One day, while sitting on my couch, about to shoot another shot, I thought, "This is stupid. I don’t want to die like this." I realized I was giving up on myself. Meanwhile, my wife, son, and mom were doing everything they could to cheer me up and offer me a way forward.

<Figure src="/stories/mike/Mom.JPG" caption="Me with my mom and Leo." fit="contain" size="sm" />
One way I tried to cheer myself up was to play positive music - Michael Franti, Shaggy, Jack Johnson, and Ziggy Marley. Music is magic for the soul.  So are words.  When I listen to  music, I feel my soul if that makes sense.
The same goes for hopeful, happy music.  Words are magic for the soul too.  The words I surround myself with matter.  So, I have to choose to surround myself with positive people, especially when I am down.  

Now, I try to choose the words I say aloud and let it linger in my mind.  Music is powerful, transformational, healing.  So are words.  I had enough of my own negative words on the inside.   I’m thankful our house was one of positivity, even when I didn’t feel that way in the moment.

Another thing my wife and mom did to cheer me up and offer me a way forward was find organizations in town with whom I could volunteer.  They wanted me to look past myself and see that there’s something I could do for others or at least for my own well-being.

One day, I begrudgingly filled out an application to volunteer at Sara Bellum’s bakery here in Portland.  It was founded by Dr. Rik Lemoncello, Professor of Speech-Language Pathology at Pacific University.  Its mission is to assist adults with acquired brain injury to develop functional, job-ready social, cognitive, and physical skills to assist with ongoing development and rehabilitation in a functional, real-world setting.  

I needed to hit rock bottom before I reached out. The day I said, "This is stupid. I don’t want to die like this," was my rock bottom. I’m grateful my wife, son, and mom stuck with me through it and they had ideas of how to get me out of the house.

On my first day, I was curious and excited to be around other people, sweets, and frosting.  I was nervous though that I would want to eat everything.  I can't eat solid foods.  Would it be torture?  I was scared that I would get hunger pains and grow hangry or that my short term memory struggles would get in the way.  And, I feared that I wasn’t good at meeting new people. 

I didn’t know anyone at the bakery. But when you enter, it’s the kind of place where you're immediately greeted with a joyful, “Hi! Welcome!” I’ve been involved for four years now, and I’m still greeted that way. People there are happy, patient, and genuinely get to know each other. Did I mention patient? Everyone truly understands. We help each other out and laugh together too.

When I walked in that first day, I saw the aprons hanging to my right. There were boxes of hair nets on the counter—two sizes. I didn’t have a hat on, so Head Chef Daniel told me to grab a hair net. I chose the smaller size, thinking my head wasn’t too big. But the net was tiny and tight on my head. When I looked up, someone said, “That’s the beard net!” We all laughed! Ha! No wonder it felt so tight on my noggin. That definitely broke the ice.

There are baking instructions next to each station. We have to try to do math, and read, and remember if we’ve added baking soda, etc. We practice speaking while engaging with each other, and we get to try and try again—with so much patience.  We help each other out and there are speech pathology students there to lend a hand too.

How many people get to go to work happy, no matter the problem? That’s what we get to do! After months of sitting at home feeling lonely and sorry for myself, I had no idea this job and vibrant community were waiting for me. I need them, and they need me!

<Figure src="/stories/mike/Mike.jpeg" caption="." fit="contain" size="sm" />

We don’t have expectations of each other. We are just happy that each person shows up.  We are vulnerable which deepens our mutual trust.  I want to be a voice of trust.  I’ve been lonely for a long time but all these people have appeared in my life.  We spend only 4 to 5 hours together each week but we leave full and happy.

I learned to let go of my prestroke friends who disappeared. The process was tough, but when I finally did, it felt good. We parted ways, and though I was angry at first, I’m not anymore. People grow apart.  I wish them all the best. The moment I let go, my new best friend walked into my life.

Kylie from the bakery had organized a meet up at the pumpkin patch for Halloween.  Brad introduced himself right away.  He’s like that.  He wants to meet everyone and he’s interested in people.  He asks good questions.  He puts others at ease by reaching out.  It can be scary for people with brain injuries to break into a group of people.  Some people don’t understand and judge, so many of us hesitate to put ourselves out there and meet new people.  And if we do, it usually takes time before we open up.  Brad made that easier for me and for everyone else by taking initiative and introducing himself and asking questions.

<Figure src="/stories/mike/cornfield.JPEG" caption="Our Halloween pumpkin patch outing!" fit="contain" size="sm" />
Then the day went on.  Imagine all of these people with brain injuries trying to find their way through a corn maze.  It was so fun!  The way we interacted, problem-solved, and laughed together was so much fun!  When the day was done, Brad took initiative and approached me to say goodbye.  My mom was there and afterward she kept calling him “the good looking man.”

Later, we were given the same shift at the bakery.  We had a lot of fun with the other people on our shifts and always enjoyed each other's company.  One day, Amy and I were given tickets to an auction.  Amy and our friend Dave’s family had a bidding war over a fishing trip.  We won, then invited Dave and Brad on the trip.  That night was a blast.  And, we went fishing!  That was a pinnacle moment.  I was finally finding new friends.

Then Brad invited my family to his house for dinner.  It had really been a long time since Amy, Leo, and I had been invited to another family’s house for dinner.  It was so good.  Brad's wife cooked tomato soup for us. They remembered I still only can swallow liquids. The best tomato soup I have ever had. We had a great time!

Man, it was so good but I knew I had to take it slow.  I was like a little boy. “Should I text him? No, maybe I should wait.”  

Now we text all the time.   I’m friends with Dr. Brad the dentist!  I never thought I would be friends with a dentist!  We make plans to meet up.  It’s just so exciting.  I always want to learn more about him.  I’m in the process of painting my walls and he wanted to come over and help.  Our friendship has built and built and built.  It’s been really cool.  I can’t wait to learn more, plan more, experience more…together.  This is really meaningful for me because I haven’t had a buddy-friendship for a really long time.

My mom and wife were right.  I needed to get out of my own situation and do something different.  When I showed up that first day at the bakery, I wasn’t sure how it was going to go.  **I didn’t think I was good at meeting new people.  But I did know that staying at home every day wasn’t working for me.  I had to change something.  And change is hard and can be risky.**

Even now, when I have down days, I force myself to find things to do.  I’ll go outside and watch the birds or go for a walk.  I’ll set up a volunteer opportunity to look forward to.  I’m no longer coaching at the high school level but I help out with my son's youth program.  Sometimes I grab cans of food and just drop them off at the food bank.  Or bring hot food to someone.  Life, and my life skills students have taught me to look past myself and know that there’s always something I can do for others.

Next, I want to be a voice of trust for stroke and TBI survivors.  I have been there and still am.  Brad and I have started a conversation group called Kindness: Finding a Positive Way Forward, which welcomes stroke and TBI survivors to explore ways to think positively about the healing journey, using kindness as a catalyst (see more at the end of this story for information on when we meet).

<Figure src="/stories/mike/ChooseKindness.jpeg" caption="Me and Brad with matching Choose Kindness shirts, and our other friend ______." fit="contain" size="sm" />

 I’m not a medical professional but I do have life experience. My experiences have taught me that we are all vulnerable. Most of us have lost close friends and our former ways of life. And we're angry. We're scared. We're afraid we're not going to be accepted again. We're just trying to figure out who we are. The more that we're all together at the Sara Bellum’s bakery, or working at the Resilience Seed Farm, the more we can start to become. Then, you see it – the real person underneath who has accepted who they are. And whether that may be walking slow or laughing even when you’re unsure whether something was funny, that's just the way you are. I think they can feel good and safe about that. 

**I’ll be like a bird in the nest.  We are in this together.  We are all continuously learning individually and together.**

<Figure src="/stories/mike/dogpeople.JPG" caption="__________." fit="contain" size="sm" />

My teaching and life experience has taught me that when you give someone attention and believe in them, big things can happen.  I want to do that for other people.  I’ve found it and now I want to share it.

My mom and my wife gently pushed me to apply for volunteer positions.  If you have someone to gently push you to put yourself out there and also believe in you, it can make all the difference in the world. You may feel lonely but you are never alone. Come find Brad and I during our Kindness meetings. We all have something in our lives to give.  

When I am in a group of survivors, I can feel that people are listening, that they understand, that we trust each other and that we are all learning from each other.  We don’t have to be group facilitators to help others.  We can show up and listen.  We can be patient with each other and believe in each other.  We are all doing the best we can.  

I’ve grown to be more in tune with my feelings.  I hope to be with people as they navigate their own journey.  **Now, I’m learning what my students, loved ones, and the world has been teaching me all along. I hope to use my life experience, look past myself, and know that there’s always something I can do for others.**
