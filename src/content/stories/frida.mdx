March 31, 2020—I left work with a pounding headache, skipping my workout to rest. The next morning, April Fool's Day, I headed to the hospital, where I served as the Nutrition Manager. After a morning Zoom meeting, I collapsed. Boom. I couldn't stand up.
My coworkers heard the crash.
"Are you okay?"
No response.  I couldn't speak!

The pharmacist and dietitian on the other side of the cubical rushed over and found me on the floor. The pharmacist propped me up.  They called the rapid response team. I remember only flashes. In the ER, they found a clot in my brain and gave me a TPA injection—but nothing happened. I tried to move. Nothing.

Everything blurred. Hours later, I was transferred to Good Samaritan Hospital, a hospital well equipped for my thrombectomy. As the ambulance pulled away, I saw my colleagues waving goodbye. I was confused—and assumed I'd reconnect with them when I returned to work in a few weeks. 

I quickly realized that I was trapped in my body, unable to speak or move. My vision blurred. I couldn't hear. I wasn't scared—just confused. Was I dead? I wanted answers, but I couldn't ask.

After the thrombectomy, I woke up and tried moving my hands. It worked! Yes! Maybe I wasn't dead. Maybe I'd talk again—maybe even return to work in a couple days..

Everything to my right was still dark. I asked for my husband, but the nurses didn't understand—I wasn't speaking clearly. I tried texting, but my words were gibberish. At least I was making noise.

The only word I could say clearly was "water." Yes—water. No—water. Husband—water. Every word came out the same. It was so frustrating.

By day four in the ICU, I could move. The physical therapist helped me sit up, plant my feet, and shuffle forward. Step by step—heel, toe, balance. Walking was more complex than I ever realized.

COVID restrictions left me alone most of the time.  But one day, my husband called and told me to look out the window. I used what the therapist taught me—sat up, planted my feet, heal, toe, balance.  I shuffled to the window on my own. Below, I saw him waving. I felt so lonely without him and our two dogs.

On day five, they discharged me. My husband arrived and told me, "You've had a stroke and are experiencing Aphasia." I worked in the medical field, so I knew about strokes, but it still didn't sink in. Everything was blurry and confusing. He helped me into the car and drove me to rehab. I still thought I'd return to work after—just one more hurdle.


In rehab, restrictions continued - so isolating - no visitors, no interactions with other patients. I ate alone in my room and only left for therapy.
"What's your name and date of birth?" they'd ask. When entering after long stretches of solitude.  I couldn't recall or explain.  I couldn't answer or engage.
When the kitchen called to confirm my meal order, I wished they'd just ask yes or no questions—I could manage those words.
It was so frustrating. I longed to be home with my husband and dogs. I cried alone every day. Finally, the facility eased restrictions and let my husband visit. He brought our dogs Teddy, then Daisy. My family was out of town, and flights were grounded due to COVID.  It was so lonely between visits.

I listened to music to survive. The Pink Martini songs, "Tomorrow" and "Hang On Little Tomato" gave me hope.
You gotta hold on
Hold on through the night
Hang on
Things will be alright
Even when it's dark and not a bit of spark
Sing-song sunshine from above
Spreading rays of sunny love

In rehab, my recovery began. I learned to say my name, my husband's name, the dogs' names, numbers, days, and colors. My husband researched aphasia treatments and downloaded apps so I could practice words on my iPad. I like deadlines and meeting them, so I thought rehab would help me speak again, and in three weeks, I'd be back to work.

After three weeks in rehab, I was finally discharged.  At home the next morning, we had a Zoom meeting with the Aphasia Center and set up speech classes to start the next week. I learned words, but not full sentences.
I tried asking how long it would take to regain my speech—using signs, gestures, and drawings. Finally, my husband told me I could regain my speech, but we didn't know how long it would take.  I'm thankful for his optimism.  I had something to work toward and a partner to encourage my efforts.

I clearly understood that I had a stroke and aphasia. Before the stroke, I was intensely dedicated to my career. I earned two bachelor degrees and later a master degree in nutrition. My passion was to help people through nutrition.  I became a Dietician and managed others.  Then, in an instant.  It was gone.  I felt lost and angry. 

I was bilingual—Spanish is my native language, and I learned English at 14. Learning English was the hardest thing I'd ever done. Despite speaking two languages, I lost both.

My frustration and anger showed.  I even hit a point when I was so overwhelmed that I scratched the walls because I couldn't express what was happening.

At home, everything was labeled. One aphasia treatment recommendation is to label items, so I could read and practice their names—mirror, door, table, chair, counter, etc. In the first few months after the stroke, I learned more words—my city, my last name, relatives' names. My parents and I had daily phone conversations to practice Spanish.

I set a new deadline of three months—Paid Family Medical Leave lasts 12 weeks, enough time to heal. I learned to ask, "When can I go back to work?" I asked every speech therapist, online and in-person, and they all said they didn't know. One therapist told me I might never return to work. I was furious and cried angry tears—not at them, but at my situation. I later found out that several doctors and nurses had told my husband this as well, but he didn't share it with me for years, believing they were wrong and didn't understand my abilities. Determined to speak again, I promised myself I would return to work and be my normal self again.

In my first year of recovery, I had 4-6 speech therapy sessions daily and worked on aphasia apps in my spare time. My husband helped me journal, and we practiced naming things on all our outings.  I often felt discouraged, thinking I wouldn't return to work, but support from coworkers, friends, and family kept me going. 
When I felt alone, I turned to the internet, searching for "Young women with aphasia." I found just one account—an 18-year-old woman from the UK. Her updates were informative, but the age gap made it hard to fully relate. I was 30, searching for answers and understanding.
Six months after my stroke, I told my husband, "I can't find anyone my age who's overcome aphasia. When I get better, I'll make videos to show others it's possible!" 
"Why not start today?"  He was right.  It's about the journey.
That first day, I sat at the table and thought about what I was going to say in my first video.  I created a script to make sure to remember the important points I wanted to get across.  It was very difficult and a lot of work but I knew that it could be helpful for other people like me, young women with Aphasia in search of resources and hope.
I made videos about my stroke, lifestyle changes, and returning to work with aphasia.  Although it was challenging, it was worth it.
In time, I started hearing from stroke survivors with aphasia.  They too were looking for resources and helpful tips in navigating daily life.  They shared that my journey gave them hope.  That motivated my recovery.  When I reached out, I felt less isolated and so did they.  I found great purpose in my efforts, connection too.  I post and communicate with survivors in both English and Spanish.  Now I realize that sharing my journey is just as much for them as it is for me.  It is so important for me to raise awareness about aphasia.

When I post videos, I share struggles and tips like using sticky notes and subtitles. 
I'm grateful to say that I am back to work but that also means that I'm not posting as often.  I keep the videos up so that young women with aphasia can find me - know that I understand their struggles, that it takes a lot of hard work, that it is an emotional journey, and that there's hope.  The brain and body are amazing.  I keep the videos up to offer the hope I so desperately searched for.  
Aphasia is often misunderstood—people think it's just silence, but it's the loss of words. Many assume those with aphasia are less intelligent.  The wisdom and knowledge is still there, just difficult to access. Aphasia also makes speech sound blunt.  In trying to get our point across,  we often struggle to add fluffy descriptors.  That doesn't mean we are short with people because we are angry with them or don't like them.   In this way people with aphasia are often misunderstood and further isolated.  I struggle with numbers, pronouns, and spelling.  I don't mean to offend people by calling them a different gender or saying they are way older or younger than they are.  I am just struggling to access the correct words.  
One way people could support me and others with aphasia is to practice understanding.  We are trying.  Give us the benefit of the doubt.  Another, practice patience.  When we are struggling to find a word, give us some time to try.  The more we try, the more we engrave the pathways in our brains and the more we develop confidence to engage.  Think of these word retrievals as mini wins!  When we find a word, we should celebrate!  If you feel too uncomfortable in the moment of silence, when we are trying to find the word, simply ask, "would you like help?"  

I'm deeply grateful for the privilege of reclaiming my voice. I once felt trapped, unable to express my thoughts, but now I carry the responsibility to speak out—educating others about aphasia and breaking the misconceptions that silence so many.
A lifetime of knowledge, wisdom, and experience remains intact within us, yet aphasia locks it away—struggling to break free and be shared with the world.   We often lose our jobs, relationships, and friends while we so desperately work to express ourselves.  We also learn to practice patience and understanding.  In doing so, we find that we never fully lose ourselves but have an opportunity to be our best selves.  When we push through the tough times and connect with others, we find a new purpose.  We find each other and offer hope.
In sharing my story, I work to offer hope, connect with others, and live with purpose.  I am a young woman living with aphasia.  Therapy and recovery are difficult but so worth the effort.  I work each day to shine as my new normal self.  I invite others to do so too.  Our recovery journeys don't stop unless we stop.  May we boldly share our unique journeys with aphasia, shaping a world of understanding and hope.
