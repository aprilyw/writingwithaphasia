# Test Demo Story (Heading)

This is a test / demo story used to validate the MDX pipeline and component rendering. It intentionally includes a variety of elements.

<Separator />

## Basic Paragraphs

Regular paragraph with a [link to external resource](https://example.com) that should open in a new tab and have proper rel attributes.

Another paragraph referencing an inline image component below.

## Image Figure

<Figure src={frontmatter.hero} alt="Hero Reference" caption="Hero image reused for demo purposes" />

## Image Grid

<ImageGrid columns={2}>
  <Figure src="/stories/ayse/Flowers.jpg" alt="Flowers" caption="Flowers" />
  <Figure src="/stories/ayse/Dog.JPEG" alt="Dog" caption="Dog" />
  <Figure src="/stories/ayse/Now.jpg" alt="Now" caption="Now" />
  <Figure src="/stories/ayse/NeverGiveUp.JPEG" alt="Never Give Up" caption="Never Give Up" />
</ImageGrid>

## Video Embed

<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="Sample Video" />

## Headings & Anchors

### Subsection A

Content under subsection A.

### Subsection B

Content under subsection B with more text to ensure slug generation works.

## Separator Again

<Separator />

## Closing Thoughts

This concludes the demo. If you can read this page under `/stories/test-demo` and see all components styled consistently, the integration works.
