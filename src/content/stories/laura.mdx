I’m multi-dimensional - like a gemstone. Born of Lithuanian descent, I’m 70 years old and slender and tall for a woman. I’ve been told I look Baltic. I was a business professional in the STEM field. In my twenties, I was married young, and I was a widow. Too young to be a widow, I was told. I’m a mother - and now I’m a grandmother. I’m all of these things, and many more. Now I’m a stroke survivor.

I grew up in Brockton, Massachusetts, the second of five children. My dad was a WWII veteran. When he returned to the U.S., he married my mom and became a mail carrier while my mom became a homemaker.  

Catholic, I went to a parochial school from first to fourth grade. When we were forced to move (urban renewal), we moved to the north side of town – closer to the Lithuanian community. There, I went to public school from fourth grade until I graduated high school. The nuns scared me with the belief that I wouldn’t get a good education - but they were wrong I think. 

I always had an interest in art and took prizes for my artwork. I made my own clothes. Home Economics! I also excelled in math and science. In junior high, I was put in advanced classes for these subjects as well as for French. I loved French (I would even talk on the phone with my friend in French).

Around this time, my dad had 2 jobs - and my mom needed to go back to work. Money was always tight. I was made the designated babysitter in seventh grade so no extra-curricula activities for me. I became studious, almost nerdish - with big tortoise shells glasses to boot. I was frequently in my room, reading, with my cats keeping me company.

My mom liked cats, and we had an assortment of cats in the house - mostly strays. When I went to Boston College, I got a dog. A Husky, I named her Kimo. I enjoyed her but didn’t factor in puppy training. Kimo was teething and ate part of my sofa, so I had to find a new home for her. Dogs! Sigh.

When I had to declare a major, I picked economics and statistics over history. And I had a great work-study job to supplement food stamps; I worked in the computer center - first in operations and then programming.  

Boston College had core requirements for theology and philosophy. I met my soon-to-be husband, Allen, in philosophy class. He was a graduate student, just observing class - and apparently me. When class was over, Allen escorted me out of class - and we were inseparable after. Eventually, we lived together and we got married. My first job after college was at a DOD contractor. Hmm. I liked the second job more – programming in a forecasting group - but didn't want to be a programmer. So I went into an MBA program. Allen quickly followed suit.

After business school, I began working for computer companies in MA as a market strategy professional. Allen pursued printing and publishing.

Life was good! But then we had a car accident. I remember that Allen was driving, and I fell asleep. We were close to home, our house just beyond the curve on the rotary. I was told that one teenager was in the proper lane and one was in our lane trying to pass at high speed. Drag racing and drinking, under the influence of alcohol. They were both underage.

Just after 1am, the car traveling in our lane (trying to pass his friend) hit our car 90% head on. As I was asleep, on impact I had a conclusion but I lived; Allen died immediately. Snapped his neck at C2. If he lived he would be a quadro-palagic. Technically I should have died; the force of the impact was so great. Allen! I miss him always to this day.

I met a veterinarian skiing out west.  He suggested he wanted to move to Colorado and I thought, why not join him? I moved to Denver, Colorado, where I continued working for tech companies. Alas the veterinarian didn’t move (and I wondered why!). I traveled and met people. Eventually I met Vic, a physicist. We dated for 5 years but the future was uncertain. Then, I found out I was pregnant. All of my friends were married and having children, so I decided to become a mother. At 35, Evan was born!
***
I loved being a mom. Parenting is not easy and I had my share of frustrations being a single parent - though I talked Vic into being a father in a co-parent relationship. We didn’t live together, but Vic stopped by every day. We spent holidays together and vacationed together too. Evan, gifted in many ways, skipped a grade in elementary school. He made friends and seemed to adapt well to our family circumstances. I thought he was well-adjusted as an only child (truth is I attempted to adopt a girl but it didn’t work out in the end).

As I got older, I noted less opportunities in my field. Being the head of my household, I had to secure an income. I decided to go to school again and remorph myself. I created another path. I did the same 10 years before when I received a Masters in Telecommunications to get into the telco industry.

Working full-time, I eventually completed my prerequisites in chemistry and I got into pharmacy school. But in pharmacy school, I realized pharmacy is mostly pharmacists babysitting techs. I didn’t want this - but I learned my sciences and thought about a career in the business of pharmaceuticals. 

When Evan went to college (and eventually received his PhD), I relocated back to Massachusetts to find a job in the pharmaceutical industry. I drove from Colorado to Massachusetts with six cats. It took three days in November 2007. But we made it.

I’ve had six Colorado cats for the 18 years I’ve lived in Massachusetts.
Lifelong companions, my cats are gone but not forgotten: Storm (17) from a blood clot during tooth surgery, Savannah (17) from diabetes, Pepper (17) from a nasal polyp/respiratory distress, Margo (22) from breast cancer and Luca (20) from asthma. My MA cat, Coco (5), died suddenly of heart failure. My living cats: Percy (19) and Cayenne (14). I love all my cats! And I have a dog, Oliver, from Hawaii. He’s now 12 years old.

I always related better to animals. Maybe I’m an animal whisperer. Even without language, pets can still understand you. They know your unspoken feelings; it’s a different type of communication.

With age, job opportunities became few. So in Massachusetts, I remorphed again; I completed a biotech certificate at Boston University Medical. It wasn’t tough because I already knew chemistry, biology and drug development. Lab work was intensive but I discovered a love of pathology.

Running back and forth to class every day, I developed AFIB. I saw a cardiologist for nine months. Every time I presented issues, the nurse would administer different doses of beta blockers to lower my heart rate. Because the CHADS/VASC score said I was only ‘1’, I wasn’t required to take blood thinners.

However, I was worried because years prior to my AFIB diagnosis, I had what was commonly known as an eyestroke. To ease inflammation, I opted to have shots of avastin in my eye every month for two years. I explained all of this to my cardiologist but he said I was only at low risk for a stroke. Hmm.

***
When I had the stroke, I was in Colorado. My son and I were there for Thanksgiving weekend and we were staying with his dad Vic. 

The day before, I had a headache. A bad headache. I have had migraines before, so I thought it was just a bad headache. I ran out of aspirin the day before, but I had been chewing down aspirin not knowing what was going on in my body or head. Finally, I went to bed.

And thank God I woke up in the morning because of a phone call. I attempted to answer it, and I couldn’t speak. I went to the kitchen and Vic said "What's wrong?” He woke Evan and we were off to the hospital.

Timing is everything regarding a stroke. Second and minutes matter. If I was asleep longer, maybe I would have paralysis - or might even be dead!

When I got to the hospital, I couldn’t talk. I didn’t have any language. People were asking me questions and I was writing or drawing symbols. I remember the ER doctors saying I was smart. Of course. I didn’t have a TPA because I was taking aspirin en route to the hospital. At the hospital, I only had an MRI to determine I had a stroke. I released myself as soon as possible. They couldn’t do anything for me. I discharged myself, and I went back to Boston.

Back in Boston, my neurologist said I had total aphasia. I didn’t know anything about aphasia. He said, “This is the hardest thing to come back from – aphasia, not paralysis. Aphasia.”

***

After my stroke, I needed to redefine myself again. I’m now a stroke survivor. Sometimes, I say I was a stroke victim because I was victimized by my stroke. So much of identity is oriented around the other things you’ve done, but I had to park all of this when I became a stroke survivor.

Learning to speak again was hard. Real hard. With years of effort I gained proficiency. When I thought I talked ‘more normal’ (HA!), I thought maybe I could be employed in a professional capacity, because I needed intellectual stimulation - and I was bored. But interviews went nowhere. Maybe they would go nowhere without my stroke but I was conscientious of aphasia.
I stuttered and stumbled and used the wrong words. So frustrating.

The aphasia journey has been up and down. I have word finding issues as well (not just presentation and pronunciation). Recently, I saw an audiologist about a blocked ear. The audiologist said, “I noticed something with your presentation. You described your ear as cloudy. Most people would say it’s blocked.” Hmm. After eight years, still.

By all of my friends' accounts, I made significant progress daily, weekly, monthly, yearly – for the first three years. And then I plateaued. My friend John said he agreed with this comment. I talk slower now but John says I used to talk at a hundred miles an hour; I was rattling off things, processing my thoughts, speech and elocution without hesitation. Now, I speak slowly and somewhat flat; I think I had more prosody.  Friends say they’ve gotten used to my new speech pattern.

But even if it’s marginal returns, I think I’m always improving. If I have mental stimulation, I’ll continue to improve. This has been my journey along with speech therapy, and aphasia classes at BU for six years.

I’ve had challenges. I had an incident in a grocery store. I thought I was communicating, but a woman demeaned me because I got tongue tied. And when you get emotional, it supersedes language. Jerry, a speech pathologist at BU, said, “You know, language is primarily frontal lobe. If you’re calm and you’re processing, you can speak.”

Two years ago, my diabetic cat, Savannah, couldn’t move her limbs. Panicked, I took her to the vet. He suggested euthanasia but I didn’t euthanize her. Instead, I went to a vet who specializes in cat neurology at the veterinary referral hospital. 

The neurologist said “Savannah doesn’t know what’s going on; she can’t move three of her limbs. Poor thing! She has a spinal clot, NOT A BRAIN CLOT.”

I said, “What do I need to do?” 

The vet said, “Start by moving her limbs.” I told her I had no idea how to move her limbs.  She said to me, “If you have a bag, make cutouts in the bag and place her in the bag. You can assist her walking. But don’t be hard on her or yourself. Just do the best you can and evaluate. Day by day, week by week, just monitor her progress. Then decide!”

I said that I didn’t know what I was doing, or if I could do something for my cat but the vet said, “You had a stroke. The cat had a stroke. The cat is worth saving. And what better circumstances? You had a stroke. You know what to do.” And I left feeling empowered.

In essence, I didn’t know what I was doing, but I was determined. I bathed Savannah daily because she urinated on herself. The cat didn't like water and in the sink she was doing her best to kick. My Savannah. After a week, I didn’t know if I could continue - but later, she moved. Incredible. She moved from my  bedroom to the bathroom litter box. Savannah dragged herself to poop! Yahh! And it was all uphill from there. 

Savannah recovered full mobility because I didn’t give up on her. She made a full recovery from her spinal stroke with PT in my sink.

Savannah lived another year or more.  One day, I thought she was lethargic and took her to her vet that suggested euthanasia. I had a testing instrument to test her blood sugar - an Alpha Trax. She registered LO and the vet suggested she was in remission. They administered saline after a test and we went home. Two hours later, she died. Savannah went into shock because she was hypoglycemic - not in remission. She needed glucose or dextrose, not saline. 

It took me a year to file a complaint with the veterinarian board. I didn’t hear more, but I found out it was being prosecuted. 

Sometimes, people don’t know what they’re doing. Legal battles are dicey. It’s case by case. It’s a human characteristic or emotion to be angry. Sometimes, you’re in the wrong place at the wrong time and there’s no one to blame. But sometimes there is a wrong-doer, someone to blame. I thought my former cardiologist was guilty of malpractice but the attorney who defended him made me look like the culprit. I lost this one.
