<span className="text-2xl">**Hell**</span> <br />
By Cindy Yee Lam Walker

At New York City <br />
My parents and I are at a restaurant <br />
Very crowded <br />
Later we are back at our house <br />
I am happy

All of a sudden<br />
I am awake!<br />
I look around <br />
Everything is white <br />
Where am I?<br />
Where are my parents?<br />
Suddenly I realize <br />
they are gone<br />
My heart is broken!

In the white room<br />
A man holds my hand<br />
Who is he?<br />
I kind of remember him<br />
I try to speak but<br />
I can’t talk<br />
What is happening?

A lady comes in<br />
gives me some medicine <br />
Another lady asks <br />
what food do you want tonight?<br />
I can’t talk<br />
She asks 1 or 2 <br />
I don’t care but<br />
I nod my head<br />
So she can go away!

When the dinner comes <br />
I don’t want to eat<br />
Food looks terrible<br />
I throw them all away!<br />
I want to brush my teeth <br />
A lady comes to help me<br />
with my wheelchair <br />
I see me in the mirror!<br />
My hair is very short <br />
What happened?

I try to sleep but can’t!<br />
I hate this room<br />
I want to sleep!<br />
I will see my parents in my dreams<br />
I will be happy then

In the morning <br />
A lady comes in<br />
What do you want for breakfast?<br />
Milk, juice, cereal, eggs, bacon?<br />
I say “One bacon!”<br />
Nothing else<br />
This is the first sentence <br />
I have spoken!

All of a sudden<br />
I remember my job<br />
Treasury Officer!<br />
I worked with money!<br />
Millions & millions of dollars <br />
Need to go back to my job soon<br />
Love my job!

Another lady comes in<br />
She talks about coins<br />
Why she talks about coins?<br />
She says 1 penny, 5 cents,<br />
10 cents, a quarter, one dollar<br />
I try to count but can’t!<br />
I can’t do the math!<br />
What is going on?

Another lady comes in<br />
We play with a pink putty<br />
I fold the putty into a big round ball<br />
holding it in my left hand <br />
What is going on?

Another lady comes in<br />
We go to another room<br />
I am on my wheelchair <br />
She helps me so I can stand!<br />
Very hard to stand<br />
What is going on?

I have many questions <br />
Where am I?<br />
Why I am here?<br />
What happened?<br />
Who are these people?<br />
What is going on?

I can’t walk<br />
I can’t talk much<br />
I can’t do the math<br />
I hate eating <br />
I can’t sleep <br />
I am depressed <br />
I hate my life!

I am in HELL!

<span className="text-2xl">**The Seasons of My Stroke**</span> <br />
By Cindy Yee Lam Walker


Winter


We traveled to Iceland<br />
We had a wonderful time <br />
I loved being Treasury Officer<br />
My best job ever!<br />
I loved money then <br />
My salary was great

March 19, 2019<br />
I had a ruptured brain aneurysm <br />
Surgery, the next day<br />
I was sleeping for weeks<br />
In a coma<br />
I saw my parents <br />
In my dreams<br />
When I woke up<br />
My parents were gone



Spring


In the hospital <br />
I couldn’t walk or talk<br />
No memory for three months<br />
My doctor made an adjustment <br />
And then, I “woke up”<br />
I thought I could go back to my job soon



Fall


I had to use a wheelchair <br />
When I began to speak<br />
It was difficult <br />
I wouldn’t eat<br />
I realized I couldn’t work anymore <br />
I was depressed <br />
I didn’t want to live


Winter


I thought I was the only person with Aphasia<br />
Nothing made me happy <br />
My life had no reason<br />
I asked my husband to leave me in our bedroom <br />
After one month, I would be dead<br />
Of course, my husband was very worried


Spring


My doctor prescribed some medications<br />
I began to feel better<br />
I had a wonderful speech therapist<br />
She helped me a lot<br />
I was able to read and write again 

Now<br />
I don’t care about money anymore <br />
I paint with acrylic <br />
I make origami to give to people <br />
I enjoy poetry

I live to be alive<br />
I love my husband more<br />
I have many new friends<br />
Part of our beautiful journeys<br />
Together<br />
I love my life now!

<span className="text-xl">**Conversation with my God**</span><br />
by Cindy Yee Lam Walker



Thanking my God<br />
You taught me so much <br />
Before my stroke <br />
I cared a lot about money <br />
After my stroke <br />
All I care about was being alive <br />
**And be fearless!**



Thanking my God<br />
You taught me so much<br />
When I found out <br />
I had Triple-Negative breast cancer <br />
A rare breast cancer <br />
I was surprised & confused <br />
But You taught me<br />
To accept <br />
**And be fearless!**



Thanking my God<br />
You taught me so much<br />
On my seventh chemo<br />
My Oncologist checked my breast <br />
My tumor was gone!<br />
We were so happy! <br />
However<br />
I would continue with my chemo <br />
Why?<br />
Even though, no tumor now<br />
But my cancer could come back <br />
An aggressive cancer <br />
Spreads very quickly <br />
More chemo <br />
Then, surgery <br />
Then, radiation<br />
**I accepted!**



Thanking my God<br />
You taught me so much <br />
Remembering my mother’s leukemia<br />
In her fourth chemo <br />
The cancer was gone!<br />
We were so happy!<br />
But after 4 weeks later<br />
Her cancer came back so fast<br />
Her pain was so agonizing <br />
It was time to go to heaven <br />
**She accepted!**<br />
She passed 3 weeks later<br />
No more pain in heaven <br />
She was finally happy!



Thanking my God<br />
You taught me so much <br />
From my mother’s leukemia <br />
To my stroke <br />
To my breast cancer <br />
Whatever happened <br />
**I accepted!**



Dear my God<br />
I believe You my God <br />
And Your plans for me<br />
Whatever happens<br />
**I accept!**

<span className="text-xl">**Who I Am**</span> <br />
by Cindy Yee Lam Walker 

Who I was<br />
After my stroke <br />
Depressing <br />
Feeling like I was <br />
the only person  <br />
with Aphasia <br />
Reading & talking <br />
were really really hard <br />
Starting to learn ABCs<br />
all over again <br />
My entire life changed!

Then<br />
Meeting you<br />
Learning there were <br />
many people with Aphasia <br />
Knowing that <br />
Beginning to feel <br />
a little bit better 

You taught me about <br />
Poetry<br />
Learning &<br />
Writing <br />
Expressing <br />
My Thoughts & Feelings<br />
in Poetry

In my poems<br />
My life is in sentences<br />
Many sentences <br />
Mostly good <br />
Some bad<br />
Overall<br />
In some ways <br />
My life <br />
beginning to feel <br />
better

You taught me about <br />
Expressing <br />
Describing <br />
Understanding <br />
My Stories <br />
Letting others know<br />
Who I was

Now<br />
I love me<br />
For<br />
Who I am

Thank you, Jerry<br />
For all you had done for us!

<span className="text-xs"> *I met Jerry Kaplan at Boston University, where he facilitates their Aphasia Community Group which I am now a part of.</span>
