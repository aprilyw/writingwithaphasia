My whole life, I have lived in Lynn, Massachusetts. I lived with my mother, my father and my younger brother. We were just a five minute walk away from the rest of my family: Auntie Anna, Auntie Jo, Uncle John, Auntie Ellen.

My grandfather and grandmother, the Chiaradonna's, lived right up the hill. They had come to America from Italy by boat. They were stopped at Ellis Island and ended up in Lynn because there were a lot of Italian immigrants who lived there. In Lynn, they bought land, built their house, and all nine of their children lived there with them. They ran a farm and had lambs, cows, and all sorts of fruits like pear trees, apple trees – everything. 

Because my older cousins and my aunts and uncles wanted to talk, I would play with the kids. I would always play school and it was so fun. In the summer, we would use sidewalk chalk and make hopscotches and stuff like that. I would always say, "Keep it in line. You will be first, you will be second." That's when I started to think that I could really be a teacher.

When I was in high school, we had a career day. We had to sign up for two career sessions that we wanted to attend and then go to that room, sit at a desk, and listen to professionals from that career. At the time, I really wanted to be a photographer. I had tons of pictures. I was still interested in teaching, but in high school, I was more interested in photography.

So, the first career talk I went to was about photography. I thought it was so exciting… until the photographer said, "news doesn't wait if you're in bed and you're sleeping. A story could happen at 2, 2:30 in the morning. Even if you are sleeping, you still have to wake up and go."

When I heard we were on call twenty-four hours a day, I thought, that's really not for me. So, I went to the session about teaching. After the teaching session, I decided that teaching was a better path for me.

I got into Boston College as an education major and decided to go there. My grandfather Borrelli wanted me to have a more stable career, so he was always telling me, "You know, if teaching doesn't work out, I have a friend at the bank who would hire you as a teller. You tell me, and it's done."

But I wanted to be a teacher, so I told my grandfather that I was going to try teaching first.

When I was at Boston College, I had a roommate, Joannie, who was also studying education. She was from Connecticut. We got along so well! We would always help each other with our class work and we would also have fun. We became best friends and still are friends to this day!

When I graduated from Boston College, I got an interview at Hood School in Lynn. I was interviewed for first grade, but when they hired me, they placed me with kindergarten. When I heard kindergarten, I was shocked. I thought, "I'm not sure I'm going to be okay with kindergarten. What if they can't hold a pencil? What if they can't tie their shoes?" I was so nervous!

But once I met the kids and saw how sweet they were, I realized I was going to love kindergarten. I knew they were going to learn everything with me.

Then I taught kindergarten for four years. During my fifth year at Hood School, they moved me up to first grade. I preferred first grade because in kindergarten, a lot of the day was about self-help, like tying shoes, putting on sweaters, coats, mittens. In first grade, we spent more time on academics. Also, the first graders could express themselves more clearly. I taught first grade for three years.

After those three years, my principal asked if I was interested in getting my Master's Degree to become an English Language Learner teacher. At Hood School, we had a lot of students who spoke Spanish at home. Peggy Galvin, my principal, had noticed that I got along well with the ELL students and that they trusted me. She suggested I get my Master's in Teaching English as a Second Language.

I got my Master's degree from Salem State University. When I finished, I became the ELL teacher at Hood School and I taught ELL for 15 years.

After my retirement party, I had two wonderful, relaxing years. During this time, I took a few trips. I went to Florida. I also went to Italy with my brother and his wife.

I was also able to spend a lot of time with my best friend, Pam, taking walks and going out to eat.

My whole life changed on April 8, 2010, when I had a stroke.

That night, I had cooked a full dinner and I was feeling fine. I went to bed. But I never woke up on time for school the next day.

My friend Deborah, who was also teaching at Hood School while I was there, noticed something was off when she went to the schoolyard and couldn't find me before school. Deborah went to the office and asked the secretary where I was. This happened right as my former principal was also asking where I was.

Deborah knew where I lived and decided to go check in on me. But, because she walked to school, she had to ask another teacher for a ride. When she got to my house, she knocked on the front door. Nobody responded. Deborah knew that I parked my car in the back, so she checked if my car was there. 

When she saw that my car was there, she immediately called 911. They connected her to the fire department. When they found me, I thought I was talking, but I wasn't making sense.

The firemen put a blanket around me. I said, "thank you." That's the only thing I remembered until three weeks later when I recovered.

***
I woke up three weeks later in the intensive care unit in Massachusetts General Hospital. Two days later after waking up, I was transferred to Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. The day that I arrived, I started working with my therapy team, which included my speech pathologist, my occupational therapist, and my physical therapist.

*Occupational Therapy.*

Four weeks later, my neuropsychologist took me to get a language evaluation. At this moment, I realized for the first time that I would have to learn to read and write again.

I told him, "I want to go back to my room. I want to go back to my room." He tried to calm me down. I wouldn't have it. I just wanted to go back to my room. 

I cried and cried. Then I said, I am going to come back from this.

***
After my stroke, there was a progression. First, I could not speak at all for three months. All I could do was shake my head: yes and no. When I did my first word spontaneously, it was at Spaulding. I said, "Tailgate!" This was because I had gone to Boston College and we were fierce competitors with Boston University. When I was thinking about Boston College, I suddenly remembered all of our tailgates. And then the word came out. 

During my time at Spaulding, I was very anxious. I needed to speak again. I would always ask my speech therapist for extra homework. 

It was also very difficult to walk after my stroke. I spent nine weeks of recovery at Spaulding. Every day, we would work on my exercises. Before my physical therapist brought me to my room, she would call in my physiatrist. My physiatrist and one of their aides would walk with me down the stairs and then back up the stairs. I was so exhausted after that I had to get in my wheelchair to go back to my room.

By the time I left Spaulding for the step-down facility, Sherrill House, in Boston, I was doing three words in a sentence. My brother got Scrabble for me. That's when I really started to learn the letters and the sounds again. I slowly began speaking more clearly.

  ]} 
/>

I would always try to formulate a sentence that had the 5 Ws. What? Who? Why? When? Where? 

I finally came home in August 2010. I did my home therapy – speech language and occupational therapy. In October, I was told to look for an outpatient facility to keep on working on my recovery. I wanted to go to Spaulding but they told me it was a six month wait. I couldn't wait that long. I ended up going to a satellite Spaulding location that was further away.

When I was doing my outpatient therapy here, my speech therapist, Jerry, said there was going to be an intensive aphasia program at Boston University for six weeks. He asked me if I wanted to be a part of this. I said yes. 

Two weeks went by and I was working with my occupational therapist when Jerry came in and told me that I was accepted into the Boston University intensive aphasia program. There was going to be a lot of speech therapy as well as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and nutrition classes at lunch. I was so happy to be accepted.

<StoryImage src="/static/img/mary/PTBU.jpg" alt="Physical Therapy at Boston University" caption="Physical Therapy at Boston University." />

When I was at the intensive aphasia program, I volunteered to participate in a pilot therapy called Constant Therapy. This entailed speech therapy every day for six months.

I also started to talk with my doctor at the Aphasia Resource Center about going back to teaching, but I didn't know if I could take a full day of school. 

I called a friend and former colleague, Helen, who was the principal at Lincoln Thompson, to ask if I could work with their ELL students. I wanted to see if I was able to teach a full school week without being too fatigued.

Helen said, "Sure, there's a lot of help that we need from you." So I went and taught the first day.

<StoryImage src="/static/img/mary/2ndESL.JPG" alt="Second grade ELL students" caption="Second grade ELL students." />

I incorporated "wait time." I would always say to the students after I spoke, "There is one minute of think time, and then we can go around the room and see what you have to say." While they were thinking, I was also formulating my words so that I could speak afterwards. While wait time is a strategy for ELL students, I could use it for my own thoughts as well.

I ended up working at Lincoln Thompson for the full school year. At the end of the year, I had a meeting with Helen. I said, "So Helen, what do you think of my language skills? Do the kids think that they can understand me? Enough that I can be back in a classroom setting?" And she said, "Of course you can be a teacher again."

The superintendent of Lynn public schools said, "I'm so glad this day has come. You have earned it. I'm going to look at the postings, and I will call you back in an hour." And then she came, she did her magic, and an hour later, she called and said, "Mary, I want to congratulate you on your new position as an ELL teacher at Lincoln Thompson." I said, "What? There isn't a job there."

The superintendent said, "there is now."

As I started my second year at Lincoln Thompson, I was asked by the Constant Therapy team I had worked with if I could speak about Constant Therapy as someone who had gone back to work after my aphasia. I agreed to be interviewed and ended up on Channel 5 News!

I stayed at Lincoln Thompson as the ELL teacher for ten years until I had accrued enough time to retire at 80%.

When I was sad at the very beginning after my stroke, I used to cry all the time when I was at Spaulding and Sherrill House. Even when I was back teaching for two years, I would go to shower and I would cry for five minutes. I would mourn the life that I lost. But then I would say, "It is a new beginning. I have things to offer, and I just have to speak slowly and formulate my thoughts and I will get them out."

I would say to others, "I have aphasia. Do you know what that is?" When they said no, I explained that it was a communication disorder that resulted from my stroke.

The last message I would like to pass is, patience, patience, patience! Because I live with aphasia, you have to be patient with me. 

I might have to take a long time to speak, but I will speak.
